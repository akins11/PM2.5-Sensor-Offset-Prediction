(PM2.5 are complex because they can be made up of numerous types of chemicals and particles and they can also be partly liquid. measured in micrograms per cubic meter. \"a microgram is a unit of weight, there are a million micrograms in a gram, & a pound = 450 grams.\"*  \n\n**Temparature ::** This is the degree or indensity of heat present when each PM2.5 was recorded using a Celsius scale. Note that higher tempemperature leads to low air quality. Also When the weather is hot primary sources of pollutants tend to increase.  \n\n**Relative_Humidity ::** Relative humidity is the amount of water vapor in the air, expressed as a percentage of the maximum amount of water vapor the air can hold at the same temperature. A high humidity increases the rate of harmful or toxic chemicals in the air. \n\n<a name=\"inspection\"><a/>\n### Data Inspection\n1. [Data Info](#info)\n2. [Missing Values](#missing)\n3. [Duplicates](#duplicate)\n4. [Outliers](#outlier)\n\n<a name=\"info\"><a/>\n#### Data Info\n\nThere are 297,177 records and 7 variables of airquality data in the training data set, also the non null count shows that tamperature, relative humidity and both sensors have missing values in them.\n\n<a name=\"missing\"><a/>\n#### Missing Values\n\nBoth PM2.5 sensors have 3,614 missing values which is 1.2% of the train data set, while both tempaerature and relative humidity have 3,549 (1.2%) of missing data.\n\n##### Question: \nThere are similar missing number of values for both sensors and also temperature and relative humidity, so are these missing records similar in the data.\n\nLooks like there were faliure/reason for skipping data entry during a specific period of time for both sensors. let get the minimum and maximum date for this missing record.\n\n<a name=\"duplicate\"><a/>\n#### Duplicates\n\n<a name=\"outlier\"><a/>\n#### Outliers\n\nBoth Sensors have some extrem large values that shows that there where some times when the sensors picked up dengerous level of Fine particulate matter around the area.\n\n##### Question:\nAre these extreme values somehow related to the periods when the pm2.5 sensors where condsidered faulty.\n\nBoth occations show that the extreme values are present inspite of whether the sensor is considered faulty or not.\n\n<a name=\"clean\"><a/>\n### Data Cleaning\nThe train data will be restructured for exploration.\n\n<a name=\"eda\"><a/>\n## Exploratory Data Analysis\n1. [Additional Variables](#add_var)\n1. [Univariate Analysis](#uni)\n2. [Multivarite Analysis](#multi)\n3. [Correlation](#corr)\n\n<a name=\"add_var\"><a/>\n### Additional Variables\n\nThe sensors PM2.5 records are numeric, a categorical variable will be created to distinguish this records for better data exploration.\n\nDefining Air Quality Index Categories\n1. **Good** :: Little to no risk (PM2.5 from 0 - 12.0)  \n2. **Moderate** :: Unusually sensitive individuals may experience respiratory symptoms. (PM2.5 from 21.1 - 35.4)  \n3. **Unhealthy** (for sensitive groups) :: Increasing likelihood of respiratory symptoms in sensitive individuals. (PM2.5 from 35.5 - 55.4)\n4. **Unhealthy** :: Increased respiratory effect in general population. (PM2.5 from 55.5 - 150.4)\n5. **Very Unhealthy** :: Significant increase in respiratory effect in general population. (PM2.5 from 150.4 - 250.4)\n6. **Hazardous** :: Serious risk of respiratory effect in general population (PM2.5 from 250.4 - 500.4)  \nsource: [U.S.Environmental Protection Agency](https//www.epa.gov)\n\nThe Datetime contains the timestamp of the data collection, from this variable the individual hour, month, and year will be extracted.\n\nChanging offset fault for better readability during exploration\n\n<a name=\"uni\"><a/>\n### Univariate Analysis\n\nThe outcome variable `offset fault`  contains only two categories which are 1/Yes for PM2.5 sensors that were considered sending faulty signals at the time and 0/No for sensors working well. From the bar chart above, there are less faulty sensors (36.95%) that faulty sensors (63.05%) overall.\n\nIn micrograms per cubic meter the minimum value for sensors 1 and 2 falls within the range -9.45 to -9.70 respectively while that maximum value falls within the range 997.96 to 997.26 respectively which shows only a very small difference, for the average value given that there are huge presence of outliers in both sensors it will be more accurate to look at the median value where 50% for sensor 1 fall between 36.65 and lower also for sensor 2 33.85 and lower.  \n\nThere was an average temperature of  23.32 degrees overall for the train set and for relative humidity 78.61.\n\n#### Sensor 1 and 2 Distribution\n\n#### Air Quality Index\n\nSensor 2 Picked up more Good PM2.5 signals (11.87%) than sensor 1 (8.51%), both sensors have just 0.03% of it recodes as hazadious while the highest Air quality index category recorded was moderate level with 39% and 41% respectively for sensor 1 and 2.\n\n#### Temperature\n\nGiven that the distibution is skewed, it shows that there are more low temperatures recorded then high temperatures.\n\n#### Relative Humidity\n\nMore high relative humidity was recorded than low relative humidity Over the selected period.\n\n#### DateTime\n\nFor the train data set the we can see that the records started from the 15th of October 2021 up to the 21st of january 2022.\n\n##### Month\n\n##### Year\n\n<a name=\"multi\"><a/>\n### Multivarite Analysis\n1. [Device Status and Particulate Matter](#dspm)\n2. [Temperature, Relative_Humidity and Device status](#trhds)\n3. [Air Quality with Temperature & Relative Humidity](#aqithr)\n\n<a name=\"dspm\"><a/>\n#### Device Status and Particulate Matter \n\nFor both sensors there where more extreme PM2.5 values recorded when no faulty signals was detected than when it was.\n\nThe Median PM2.5 for sensor 2 when no signal offset fault was detected (61.93%) is higher than that of sensor 1 (55.31%) and the reverse is the case when a fault was detected. in conclusion sensor 1 had more offset faults than sensor 2.\n\n##### Temperature, Relative Humidity and Device status\n\n<a name=\"aqithr\"><a/>\n#### Air Quality with Temperature & Relative Humidity\n\n##### Air quality from Sensor 1\n\n##### Air quality from Sensor 2\n\nFor relative humidity using the above chart the higher the critical level of PM2.5 the higher the relative humidity on an average with the exception of hazardous level. while for temperature the higher the critical level of PM2.5 the lower the degree of temperature on an average with only the exception of hazardous level.\n\n<a name=\"corr\"><a/>\n### Correlation\n\nBoth sensors 1 & 2 are highly positively correlated with each other.  \nAir quality index(AQI) from both sensors are negatively correlated with the PM2.5 values.    \nTemperature have a positive correlation with AQI while Relative Humidity have a negative correlation with AQI.  \n\n<a name=\"model\"><a/>\n##  Modelling\n\nFor the training set all missing values will be removed from the data.  \nAdditional variables such as an ordinal air quality index as integer for both sensors will be added to the training set.  \nAlso the hour and day of the year will be extracted from the datetime variable after which the datetime variable will be dropped with the Id variable as they are both high cardinality features.\n\n### Test Set\n\nAll missing values will be imputed with their respective median value and all other feature transformation done on the train set will be used on the test set.\n\nThe test set seem to have an unusual task of predicting just one class which was the time the PM sensors where considered to have no offset faults. That been said, the model only detect that there were no fault in the sensor signal 79% of the time. Given that there are only 0s i.e non offset sensors we have a percision of 100%.\n\n\n#### Store Fitted Model\n\n#### Function to Read And Predict Future Sensor offsets\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":false,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"jupyter"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"center","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"pm_notebook.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.1.149","jupyter":"python3","theme":"zephyr","toc-title":"Table Of Content","backgroundcolor":"#FEFEFF","page-layout":"full"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
